# AWS Key Management Service examples using the AWS SDK for PHP Version 3<a name="kms-examples"></a>

AWS Key Management Service \(AWS KMS\) is a managed service that makes it easy for you to create and control the encryption keys used to encrypt your data\. For more information about AWS KMS, see the [Amazon KMS documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/kms/)\. Whether you are writing secure PHP applications or sending data to other AWS services, AWS KMS helps you maintain control over who can use your keys and gain access to your encrypted data\.

All the example code for the AWS SDK for PHP Version 3 is available [here on GitHub](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/main/php/example_code)\.
