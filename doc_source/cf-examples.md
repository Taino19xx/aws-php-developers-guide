# Amazon CloudFront Examples Using the AWS SDK for PHP Version 3<a name="cf-examples"></a>

Amazon CloudFront is an AWS web service that speeds up serving static and dynamic web content from your own web server or an AWS server, such as Amazon S3\. CloudFront delivers content through a worldwide network of data centers called edge locations\. When a user requests content that you’re distributing with CloudFront, they’re routed to the edge location that provides the lowest latency\. If the content isn’t cached there already, CloudFront retrieves a copy from the origin server, serves it, and then caches it for future requests\.

For more information about CloudFront, see the [Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide](Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide)\.
